Throughout the course of CS50.
We've been taught the importance, of the algorithm that is 
Divide and Conquer.
Coudn't just let that slide.
Thus, I present to you....
Multiply and Surrender.

Use the "arrow keys" to move in this game
"Spacebar" to jump.
"Shift or Z" to dash
You can double or wall jump when needed.
...
Attacking is not a thing in this game.
So use the "cloning and decloning" system.
Hold down "C" to clone when the "clonebar on the top right" is full.
Press "CTRL" to declone and shift focus back to your previous clone. 
Please enjoy the game.
